# Equity-Printer
checks whether all the inputs are equal or not
Write a method printEqual with 3 parameters of type int. The method should not return anything (void).

If one of parameters is less than 0, print text "Invalid Value".

If all numbers are equal print text "All numbers are equal"

If all numbers are different print text "All numbers are different".

Otherwise print "Neither all are equal or different".

 The printEqual method needs to be defined as public static like we have been doing so far in the course.
 Do not add main method to solution code.
